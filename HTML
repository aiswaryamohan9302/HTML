       <B> Android</B> is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.

Most versions of Android are proprietary. The core components are taken from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is free and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License. When Android is installed on devices, ability to modify the otherwise FOSS software is usually restricted, either by not providing the corresponding source code or preventing reinstallation through technical measures, rendering the installed version proprietary. Most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed,[13] most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS)[14] which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and associated Google Play Services development platform.

Over 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google ecosystem; some with vendor-customized user interface and software suite, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung, and HTC Sense.[15] Competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS (developed by Amazon), ColorOS by OPPO, OriginOS by vivo and MagicUI by Honor or custom ROM such as LineageOS. However, the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem.[16][17]

    <DD>Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard.[86] Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.[87][88] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,[89] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.[90]</DD>

    <DD>Android devices boot to the home screen, the primary navigation and information "hub" on Android devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android home screens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the home screen.[91] A home screen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth.[92] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the home screen,[93] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.[94] Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.[95]</DD>
    <DT><H3><I><B><U>Status bar</U></B></I></H3></DT>
    <DD>Along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be pulled (swiped) down from to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness, connectivity settings (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular data), audio mode, and flashlight.[92] Vendors may implement extended settings such as the ability to adjust the flashlight brightness.[96]</DD>
    <DT><H3><I><B><U>Notifications</U></B></I></H3></DT>
    <DD>Notifications are "short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it's not in use", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification.[97] Beginning with Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean", "expandable notifications" allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification.[98]</DD>
    <DT><H3><I><B><U>App lists</U></B></I></H3></DT>
    <DD>An "All Apps" screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. The app list may be accessed using a gesture or a button, depending on the Android version. A "Recents" screen, also known as "Overview", lets users switch between recently used apps.[92]

        The recent list may appear side-by-side or overlapping, depending on the Android version and manufacturer.[99]</DD>
